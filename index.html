            <h3>introduction</h3>
            <p>The revolt of 1857 was the conscious beginning of the Independence struggle against the colonial tyranny of the British. There are various names for the revolt of 1857 – India’s First War of Independence, Sepoy Mutiny, etc.
                The revolt began on May 10, 1857, at Meerut as a sepoy mutiny. It was initiated by sepoys in the Bengal Presidency against the British officers.
                The Revolt of 1857 was a big event in India’s history. It happened 
because many Indians were unhappy with British rule. This revolt is 
also called the Indian Rebellion of 1857 or the First War of 
Independence. It was a time when Indians fought against the British 
to try to get their freedom.
Before the revolt, there were many reasons why people were upset. 
Soldiers in the British army, called sepoys, were paid very little and 
treated badly. This made them angry. The British also interfered with 
Indian customs and religions, which made people feel 
disrespected. On top of that, the British took over Indian kingdoms 
using unfair rules like the Doctrine of Lapse, which angered Indian 
rulers.
The revolt started in 1857 in Meerut when Indian soldiers refused to 
use cartridges, they believed were greased with animal fat, which 
was against their religious beliefs. This small event led to a big 
rebellion that spread to many parts of India. It wasn’t just soldiers 
who rebelled; ordinary people like farmers and leaders like Rani 
Lakshmibai also joined in.
During the revolt, important leaders like Mangal Pandey and Rani 
Lakshmibai showed great bravery. They became symbols of the fight 
against British rule. The British fought back harshly, and many 
people suffered on both sides.
Even though the revolt was eventually put down, it had a lasting 
impact. It made the British government change how they ruled 
India. It also inspired later movements for independence. The Revolt 
of 1857 showed that Indians were ready to fight for their rights and 
freedom.

            <h3>Key Leaders</h3>
            <p>Profiles of the brave leaders who led the revolt against the British Empire.</p>
            <h3>Rani Lakshmibai</h3>
            <p>Rani Lakshmibai, also known as the "Rani of Jhansi," was a courageous and influential leader during the Revolt of 1857. After the death of her husband, Rani Lakshmibai took charge of the kingdom of Jhansi. When the British refused to recognize her adopted son as the heir to the throne and tried to annex Jhansi, she led her forces into battle. Her bravery and military strategies inspired many to join the fight against British rule. Although Jhansi ultimately fell to the British, Rani Lakshmibai's legacy as a symbol of resistance and female empowerment remains strong.</p>

        <h3>Mangal Pandey</h3>
        <p>Mangal Pandey was a significant figure during the Revolt of 1857.He was a sepoy (Indian soldier) in the British East India Company's army. In March 1857, at the Barrackpore cantonment near Calcutta (now Kolkata), Mangal Pandey refused to use the new cartridges rumored to be greased with animal fat. This refusal was based on religious beliefs because the fat used was offensive to both Hindus and Muslims.Mangal Pandey's act of defiance sparked a larger protest among the sepoys in Barrackpore. His bravery and willingness to stand up against the unjust practices of the British became a rallying point for other sepoys who were also discontented with British rule. Although Mangal Pandey was eventually captured and executed by the British, his actions became symbolic of the sepoys' resistance and contributed to the broader revolt that followed.</p>

            <h3>Nana Sahib</h3>
            <p>Nana Sahib, also known as Dhondu Pant, was a 
                prominent figure in the revolt. He was the adopted son 
                of the exiled Peshwa Baji Rao II, a former Maratha ruler. 
                When the British refused to grant him his adopted 
                father's pension after his death, Nana Sahib became a 
                staunch opponent of British rule. He played a key role 
                in the rebellion in Kanpur, where British forces suffered 
                heavy losses during the siege of Cawnpore (Kanpur). 
                Nana Sahib's leadership and military actions 
                showcased the organized resistance of Indian forces 
                against the British.</p>

        <h3>Bahadur Shah II</h3>
        <p>Bahadur Shah II, also known as Bahadur Shah Zafar, 
            was the last Mughal emperor and became a symbolic 
            leader of the revolt. Although he was a figurehead 
            with limited political power by the time of the revolt, 
            Bahadur Shah II's lineage and status as the nominal 
            ruler of Delhi gave legitimacy to the uprising. He was 
            proclaimed the leader of the rebellion in Delhi, and 
            his authority served as a unifying force for various 
            groups fighting against British rule in the region.
            These civilian leaders, along with the 
            sepoys like Mangal Pandey, played 
            pivotal roles in shaping and leading the Revolt of 1857. Their 
            bravery, strategic leadership, and commitment to the cause of 
            independence inspired a sense of unity and defiance among the 
            Indian population during one of the most significant chapters in 
            India's struggle against colonialism.</p>
